  /**
   * Get a presigned URL for uploading files that AI agents can use during tasks.
   *
   * This endpoint generates a secure, time-limited upload URL that allows you to
   * upload files directly to our storage system. These files can then be referenced
   * in AI agent tasks for the agent to work with.
   *
   * Supported use cases:
   *
   * - Uploading documents for data extraction tasks
   * - Providing reference materials for agents
   * - Sharing files that agents need to process
   * - Including images or PDFs for analysis
   *
   * The upload URL expires after 2 minutes for security. Files are automatically
   * organized by user ID and can be referenced in task creation using the returned
   * file name.
   *
   * Args:
   *
   * - request: File upload details including name, content type, and size
   *
   * Returns:
   *
   * - Presigned upload URL and form fields for direct file upload
   *
   * Raises:
   *
   * - 400: If the content type is unsupported
   * - 500: If the upload URL generation fails (should not happen)
